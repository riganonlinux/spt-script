# spt-script

This script is meant to automate download and installation of spotify deb version, spicetify along with basic configuration (including backup of original config of spotify), and downloads themes for it too.

*Steps*
Step 1 : Clone this repo or download the file(s) and extract into your preferred folder
Step 2 : Open terminal and move to the folder where the spicetify.sh file is present, and execute
chmod +x spicetify.sh   (*this gives the user the permission to execute this script*)

Step 3 : Next, to run it, execute

./spicetify.sh    (*this starts the script*)

Continue the process till the end, if something gets stuck somewhere, just run the script again

Now, to actually use it, you have 2 options :

1. Run the actual commands, just execute spicetify in your terminal, or spicetify -h, to get a list of commands you can use with it
2. Just run set-spt-theme, and name the theme you wish to set from the given options

*Note : spotify-themes command lists all the available themes.*

Meanwhile it adds an alias to spicetify, which is basically spicetify itself, and another to make the task of theme switching easier and a one command process, which I have set up as set-spt-theme, feel free to change this as per your convenience, and all suggestions are welcome.

Will add something for setting up Dribbblish themes soon too \*wink\* stay tuned.

I have created it just recently and this is my first project on Github, so forgive me for any faults in maintaining the standards here, thank you!

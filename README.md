# spt-script

This script is meant to automate download and installation of spotify deb version, spicetify along with basic configuration (including backup of original config of spotify), and downloads themes for it too.

Meanwhile it adds an alias to spicetify, which is basically spicetify itself, and another to make the task of theme switching easier and a one command process, which I have set up as set-spt-theme, feel free to change this as per your convenience, and all suggestions are welcome.

Will add something for setting up Dribbblish themes soon too \*wink\* stay tuned.

I have created it just recently and this is my first project on Github, so forgive me for any faults in maintaining the standards here, thank you!

Meanwhile you can mail me at riganonlinux@gmail.com or contact me on Telegram, my username is therealriganb as of now.
